My final data frame has 180 rows and 68 columns. There are 180 rows because 30 different subjects 
each were measured on 6 different activities (30*6=180). The 68 columns includes variables for subject, activity, 
and the mean and standard deviation for 33 measurements.

I renamed the activities that were labeled 1:6 in the raw data to their descriptive names.
