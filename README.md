## GnCD_CourseProject

There is one script for this project, 'run_analysis.r'.
When the script is sourced to the console in R studio, it should output, among other data, 
the 180x68 'dfAverages'. dfAverages should show as a table in the top left window of RStudio.

One way to move the run_analysis script into RStudio is to clone the URL for this repo, go to Project>New Project>Version Control>git, paste the URL into Repository URL field, then create project.

The raw data for the project were downloaded from this zip folder: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

CodeBook.md explains how and why the data frame is shaped and summarized, 
adds a couple other notes, and includes a table with a summary of each variable.

Note: I made a couple commits up to an hour after the deadline of 11:30 UTC because my project submission page was showing the deadline as an hour later.
